SocketChat-JavaFX is a lightweight LAN chat application built in Java using TCP sockets and JavaFX for its graphical interface.
It enables multiple users connected to the same network to chat in real time — no external servers or internet access required.

This project demonstrates practical networking concepts (sockets, I/O streams, threading) combined with a modern GUI layer, making it a perfect reference for learning Java network programming and JavaFX.

✨ Features

Real-time local network (LAN) messaging

Host or join chat sessions dynamically

Clean and responsive JavaFX UI

Multi-client support

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Modular code structure — easy to extend (add encryption, usernames, timestamps, etc.)

⚙️ Dependencies
Component	Version	Purpose

JavaFX SDK	17+ (e.g., 23.0.1)	GUI framework for building desktop apps

💡 Note: JavaFX is no longer bundled with most JDKs (Adoptium, OpenJDK, Corretto, etc.), so it must be downloaded separately.
